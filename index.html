    <p>
      HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
      Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
      share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

   <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>

   <p>
     Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">
     Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
     <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
     introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
     <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step

     are slightly exaggerated.

   <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>

   <p>
     When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
     on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
     interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
     interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.
   </p>

   <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>

   <p>
     You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
     Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
     at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
     tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
