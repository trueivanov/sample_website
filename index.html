<h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
    .
    .
    .
    <p>
      HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
      Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
      share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

    <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>
    In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the
    Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:
  </p>

  <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #aaabdd;">
    <p>
      <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>
      <br>
      â€”Abraham Lincoln
    </p>
  </blockquote>

   <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>

   <p>
     Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">
     Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
     <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
     introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
     <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
     plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
     are slightly exaggerated.

   <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>

   <p>
     When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
     on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
     interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
     interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.
   </p>

   <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>

   <p>
     You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
     Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
     at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
     tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
